This is for Python 2

import urllib2
for url in ["https://www.learningcontainer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sample-text-file.txt"]:
    try:
        connection = urllib2.urlopen(url)
        print connection.getcode()
        connection.close()
    except urllib2.HTTPError, e:
        print e.getcode()

This one is for request only

import requests
try:
    r = requests.head("https://www.learningcontainer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sample-text-file.txt")
    print(r.status_code)
    
except requests.ConnectionError:
    print("failed to connect")

This will be a script that can be run within docker container as well after docker-compose.yaml has been executed and containers running.
